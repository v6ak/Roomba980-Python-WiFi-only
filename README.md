Roomba980-Python-WiFi-only
==========================

Unofficial iRobot Roomba Python script for connecting Roomba to your Wi-Fi.

Thanks to https://github.com/koalazak/dorita980 where much of the inner workings were derived from.
Thanks to Matthew Garrett <mjg59@srcf.ucam.org> for figuring out how to get passwords from iRobots aws cloud.

This is trimmed down from the original Roomba980-Python and slightly adjusted.
